Commentary on "Targeting with machine learning: An application to a tax rebate program in Italy"

This Commentary (co-authored with Nikolaos Papoulias) is part of the requirements of the course "Machine Learning for Economists" by Thierry Magnac for the Econometrics and Empirical Economics program at Toulouse School of Economics. We discuss the methodology of the paper by Andini et al. (2018): "Targeting with machine learning: An application to a tax rebate program in Italy". 

This Git includes the paper I wrote with Nikolaos Papoulias, the code we wrote together, and the data required for the replication of the paper.
